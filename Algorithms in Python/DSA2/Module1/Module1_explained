Part 2 of the Algorithms Specialization: Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures

Problem Set #1 should help you solidify your understanding of graph representations and graph search. 
    The programming assignment asks you to implement the SCC algorithm from the lectures, and report your findings about the SCCs of a large graph. 

Programming Assignment #1 is the most difficult one of the course (and one of the more difficult ones in the entire specialization); as always, I encourage you to use the discussion forums to exchange ideas, tips, and test cases.  If you can get through the first week of the course, it should be all downhill from there!
